    <hl>A Summary View of the Rights of British America: Set Forth in Some Resolutions Intended for the Inspection of the Present Delegates of the People of Virginia, Now in Convention. By a Native, and Member of the House of Burgesses, Volume 2 Thomas Jefferson January 1, 1770 Williamsburg, printed by Clementina Rind. London, re-printed for G. Kearsly</hl>
    
      <p>"The abolition of domestic rights of human nature, slavery is the great object of desire in those colonies, where it was unhappily in troduced in their infant state. </p>
      <p>But previous to the enfranchisement of the staves we have, it is necessary to exclude all fur ther importations from Africa;</p>
      <p>yet our repeated attempts to effect this by prohibitions, and by imposing duties whick might amount to a prohibition,</p>
      <p>have been hitherto defeated by his majesty's rfegative: thus preferring the immediate advantages of a few African corsairs to</p>
      <p>to the lasting in terests of the American states, and to the rights of human nature, deeply wounded by this infamous practice.</p>
      <p>Nay, the single interposition of an interested individual against a law was scarcely ever known to fail of success, tho' in the opposite scale were placed the interests of a whole country.</p>
      <p>That this is so shameful an abuse of a power trusted with his majesty for other purposes, as if not reformed, would call for some legal restrictions."</p>
