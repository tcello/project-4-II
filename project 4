      <hl1> Thomas Jefferson's original draft of Declaration of Independence</hl1>
           <hl2>Locating his Sources<hl2>
           <p>He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable deathin their transportation thither.</p>
           <p>This piratical warfare, the opprobium of INFIDEL Powers, is the warfare of the CHRISTIAN king of Great Britain.</p> 
           <p>Determined to keep open a market where MEN should be bought & sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce.</p>
           <p>And that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them:
           <p>thus paying off former crimes committed against the LIBERTIES of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the LIVES of another.</p>
           <p>In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injuries.</p>
           <p>A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a people who mean to be free.</p>
